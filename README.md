# Password Generator Challenge

This repository is my third challenge of many to complete within the UofT coding bootcamp I'm taking part of. 
The assignment is to create a password generator to meet the assignment's Acceptance Criteria.
The first part of this is the User Story which is as follows:

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security



## Acceptance Criteria

The Acceptance Criteria is as follows:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## To Put It Simply

The assignment is to turn this page (generated by the started code provided) which currently does nothing when pressing the "Generate Password" button

Into something that generates a password based on what options the user selects from number of characters, and the types of characters they desire the password to use
